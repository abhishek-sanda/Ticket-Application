# 🎫 Support Ticket Workflow

This is an internal tool built with Streamlit to demonstrate a simple support ticket management system. Users can create new tickets, view and edit existing ones, and see key statistics on a dashboard.

## ✨ Features

- **Create Tickets**: Add new support tickets by describing the issue and setting a priority level (High, Medium, Low).
- **View and Edit Tickets**: All existing tickets are displayed in an interactive table. Users can sort by any column and directly edit the `Status` and `Priority` of each ticket.
- **Persistent Session**: Ticket data, including new additions and edits, is maintained throughout the user's session.
- **Dashboard & Statistics**:
    - Key performance indicators (KPIs) are displayed using metrics, such as the total number of open tickets.
    - An interactive bar chart shows the number of tickets by status for each month.
    - An interactive pie chart visualizes the distribution of current ticket priorities.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

The application uses a simple client-server architecture orchestrated by the Streamlit framework. The backend logic, data processing, and UI definition all reside in a single Python script.

-   **Client-Side (User's Browser)**: Renders the HTML and JavaScript generated by Streamlit. It captures user interactions (e.g., form submissions, cell edits) and sends them to the server.
-   **Server-Side (Streamlit Application)**: A Python process that executes `ticket.py` from top to bottom in response to user interactions.
    -   **State Management**: `st.session_state` is used to maintain the ticket DataFrame in memory, ensuring data persists throughout a user's session.
    -   **Data Processing**: The `pandas` library manages all data manipulation, from creating the initial dataset to appending new tickets.
    -   **UI Generation**: Streamlit commands (`st.title`, `st.data_editor`, etc.) generate the UI components that are sent to the client for rendering.
